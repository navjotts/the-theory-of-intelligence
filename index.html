                            We start with Humans, and go backwards in the 'Evolution of Intelligence'.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            Human babies start with
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> pattern-matching </li>
                            <li> concept of 'selfishness' (survival being a subset) </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            They have at their disposal – sensory observations (vision, sound, touch, smell, taste).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They use the pattern-matching to develop more and more understanding of this world –
                            but most of that learning is centered around the single concept of 'selfishness/survival'.
                            <br>
                            (example: recognizing parents, safe corner of the house, toys/sounds that soothe them etc.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next they use the pattern-matching to develop some basic communication paradigm (language) –
                            this enables the planting of 'concept of a concept'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As soon as they reach the above stage of basic language skills, parents are able to 'teach'
                            different concepts to them.
                            <br>
                            (babies use the rich language and communication with other humans to subconsciously develop the 'concept of a concept')
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            Showing a baby 1 ball to teach 'ONE' is pattern-matching – but showing 2 balls to teach 'TWO' and further,
                            starts to be in the realm of the baby starting to understand the concept of a Number System.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="heading" style="float:left; width:10%;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once powered with the skill of developing a concept (at will), the baby's mind grows exponentially fast,
                            building hierarchies of concepts and doing a 'pattern matching on concept' itself.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            Hence, the capability to develop a 'rich language paradigm' to communicate/plant/understand a concept –
                            seems to be the biggest missing piece between human-level intelligence v/s
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> animal-level intelligence </li>
                            <li> current Deep Learning approaches </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            Example:
                            <br>
                            Let's say we want to teach a 5 year old human-kid (already having the core communication skills and the 'concept of a concept') – to open the door when the door bell rings
                        </p>
                        <ol style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            <li> you show the <u>door</u> </li>
                            <li> ring the <u>bell</u> </li>
                            <li> <u>open the door</u> </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            (a <u>concept</u> being formed with the above underlines)
                            <br>
                            Show once the above pattern – and it should be enough for the task to be successfully done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why can't we do the same with a dog?
                            <br>
                            Because a dog's intelligence system does not have the capability to develop much beyond the basic selfish/survival concept it is born with.
                            <br>
                            (1 famous concept a dog develops is 'loyalty' – but that could be put under the concept of 'selfish' again)
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It can do a pattern-match, but mostly using the sensory observations available – hence it can see the door opening, or hear the bell ringing, and try to relate it to someone entering – and it can bark (or react) as a result,
                            but its extremely hard for the dog's brain to capture the concept that the door is to be opened when the door bell rings.
                            <br>
                            (if possible, it will require extensive training to teach the dog this – which is kind of similar to what happens below)
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            Similarly, for the current (pattern-matching based) Deep Learning approaches to learn the same Door-Bell example,
                            it might need thousands of such videos where the door was opened when the bell rang, and may be then it can 'learn a pattern'
                        </p>
                        <ul style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            <li> on top of that, it probably fails if someone knocks on the door, instead of ringing the bell </li>
                            <li> if one says that the above can be solved by having a training set where 'knocks' also opened the door, then what about someone shouting "Open the door!"? </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            And so on, one can keep on coming up with more unexpected variations where a simple task could fail.
                            <br>
                            (that's why Deep Learning requires a large amount of data to be able to function in a real world scenario)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Point being – in the real complex world, the permutations are too huge to be captured in a 'pattern' –
                            hence humans needed to start learning/capturing 'concepts' to go beyond animal-level intelligence.

                            <u>Concepts</u> being 1 higher level of abstraction, need a separate medium to capture/learn them – <u>Language</u>.

                            In the current Deep Learning approach, we could have the same number of neurons as a human brain –
                            but it uses that only to do a pattern-matching of observations.
                            <br>
                            It needs the Layer of Concepts – but for that it needs the big missing piece - Language.

                        <p>
                            As discussed, animals are (mostly) capable of doing pattern-matching on sensory observations.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            They start with
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> pattern-matching </li>
                            <li> same concept of 'selfishness' (as humans) </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            What they <u>don't</u> have is enough neurons to develop any sort of 'rich' communication paradigm (Language).
                            <br>
                            That limits their intelligence to never touch the layer of concepts.
                            <br>
                            Now, some animals do show higher degrees of intelligence, and are capable to capture more concepts than the pure selfishness/survival –
                            but given the lack of a rich language, they are very limited in the complexity of concepts they can learn/capture.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:5em;">

                        <p>
                            We go another step backwards now, in the Evolution of Intelligence – to let's say the 1st intellient living organisms on earth.

                        <p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
                            These also start with 1 'core' concept – the concept of 'selish survival'.
                            <br>
                            Whether they have any pattern-matching or not, depends on which spectrum of the evolution of life on earth we are discussing, but
